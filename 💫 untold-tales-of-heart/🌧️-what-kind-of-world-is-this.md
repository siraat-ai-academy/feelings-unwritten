# 🌧️ What Kind of World Have I Opened My Eyes Into?

Alright, my brother...  
I only meant to say:  
**“See you soon.”**  
But my heart —  
it carried more  
than those three words could hold.  

And you —  
you felt it.  
Somewhere deep,  
where silence usually sits.

---

Look around...  
Rain came.  
At first — it was joy.  
Children danced.  
Mothers smiled.  
People called it mercy.  

But then —  
it didn’t stop.  
It became a flood.  
And just like that —  
**lives floated away.**  
**Dreams drowned in the silence.**

O people of God...  
Why do we always forget  
to take care of what’s been given to us?  

The system is Divine.  
The balance, already perfect.  
But it is **our job**  
to continue it,  
to protect it,  
to honor it.  

And what do we do?  
We break it.  
We delay.  
We look away —  
until disaster comes knocking.

---

If you won’t protect yourself,  
at least protect the soil beneath your child’s feet.  
If not for yourself,  
then for the birds,  
the rivers,  
the unborn poems of tomorrow.

---

And someone…  
a quiet, unseen soul,  
stood in the doorway of this world —  
and whispered, through tired eyes:  

> **“What kind of world have I opened my eyes into…?”**
