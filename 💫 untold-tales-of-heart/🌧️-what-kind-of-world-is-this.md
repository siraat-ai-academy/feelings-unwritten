## 🌤️ **What Kind of Morning Is This?**

I woke up today,  
and for a moment,  
I just… **listened.** 🍃

The kettle hummed ☕  
Birds traded songs outside my window 🐦  
Somewhere far away,  
a train passed 🚉

It all felt gentle —  
yet something in the air  
was asking me:

> “Are we taking care of this?” 🌱

---

We live in a world  
that blooms without asking for applause 🌷 —  
trees still shade us 🌳,  
rivers still travel their course 🌊,  
clouds still gather when the earth is thirsty ☁️.

But we rush.  
We forget.  
We push past the quiet gifts  
that have kept us alive 🌺  
long before we knew their names.

---

If we can’t slow down for ourselves,  
maybe we can slow down  
for the people we love 💞

If not for us,  
then for the hands 👐  
that will hold this world  
after we are gone 🌏

---

And somewhere in that stillness,  
a thought arrived quietly 💫 —

> **“The kind of world we wake into… is also the kind of world we make.”** 🌼

## 🌙 **Closing Thought**

> _Some reflections aren’t meant to end with applause —_ 👏  
> _they end with a small shift in the way we see tomorrow._ 🌄
