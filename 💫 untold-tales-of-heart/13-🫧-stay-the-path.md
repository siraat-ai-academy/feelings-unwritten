## 📖 A Gentle Everyday Story  

Daniel had been trying to fix a leaking tap in his kitchen 🚰 for hours.  
He tightened bolts, replaced a washer, even watched two YouTube tutorials.  
Still, the drip… drip… drip… continued.  

Frustrated, he pushed the tools aside.  
> “Maybe I’m just not good at this,” he muttered.  

Later that evening, his neighbor walked in to borrow some sugar.  
She glanced at the tap, turned a small valve under the sink, and the drip stopped instantly.  

Daniel laughed in disbelief.  
> “I spent the whole day struggling… and it took you ten seconds.”  

She smiled:  
> “Sometimes, it’s not about working harder — it’s about staying long enough for the right answer to arrive.”

## 💬 Reflection  

In work, relationships, and personal goals, we all face “leaky tap” moments —  
small problems that feel endless, draining, and impossible to solve.  

But very often, the answer is closer than we think.  
The key is not to walk away too soon.  

🌟 **Stay the path.**  
🌟 **Trust the process.**  
🌟 **Your turning point might be only one small adjustment away.**
