# 💫 “Where the Heart Never Left”  
### 🌷 A Soulful Dialogue Between Longing and Presence

---

🌺 **Where are you, my friend?**  
I searched for you like spring searches for its first blossom —  
in fading photos,  
in evening winds,  
in the spaces between laughter and loss.  

🌿 Where did you go?

Every day now carries your name  
like an echo tucked in petals.  
Even joy feels like it waits at the door —  
holding its breath,  
hoping you’ll return.

You say you’re gone —  
but then why does the breeze hum your memory?  
Why do the stars blush like you just looked at them?

🌸 "Where are you?"  
I ask again — not with voice,  
but with a teardrop held too long.  

And then...  

🌼 A hush.  
A heartbeat.  
A breath.  
A truth.

🕊️ A voice — not from outside,  
but from the soft soil of my soul:  

> **“My dear friend,  
> I never left.  
> I’ve always been blooming quietly  
> in the garden within you.”**

## 🌷 Final Whisper

> _Some friends don’t walk beside you...  
> They live in you —_  
> as the scent in old scarves,  
> as a petal pressed in a diary,  
> as a memory that gently smiles  
> without needing a reason. 🌙
