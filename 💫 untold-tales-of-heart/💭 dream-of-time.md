## 📖 *A Tale — A Dream Wrapped in the Quiet of Time*

🕰️ One morning,  
I woke up…  
No noise.  
No movement.  
Just a shadow sliding along the walls 🍃 —  
as if time had quietly unfolded its secrets.

👁️ I looked at the world —  
and my gaze paused.  
Every scene felt like a forgotten photograph 📷.  
Every face was wrapped in a soft mist 🌫️.

💭 Someone asked:  
**"Where are you in life right now?"**  
I stayed silent —  
Because some feelings  
refuse to shrink into words.

---

🌫️ Silence spoke.  
Stillness called out:  
**"What’s weighing on you?"**

I wrestled with myself,  
But no answer came —  
Only a stillness that felt… eternal.

---

🌱 I realised:  
We are never truly complete.  
Every time we think we’ve arrived,  
we find a new path,  
a new absence,  
a new longing 🌊.

🌫️ I’ve seen faces —  
the closest of bonds 🤝 —  
slip quietly into the fog,  
without even a goodbye.

❤️ Yet my heart refuses “farewell.”  
There’s still so much:  
to say,  
to hear,  
to set right.

---

🌍 This world,  
these challenges,  
these scattered dreams —  
they’re still calling my name.

🌟 And me?  
I have no intention of turning away.

---

🛑 So —  
No goodbyes.  
No farewells.

Just say this much:  
**Take care…  
the story is still being written.** ✨
