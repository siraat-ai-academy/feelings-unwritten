### 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This is not just a collection of text.  
It’s a soft space for those feelings that were never spoken — only lived.  
Here, every line is a whisper from the soul. Some in English. Some in Urdu.  
But all from the heart.

Each piece is stored in both languages to reflect the dual nature of our inner worlds —  
**where understanding meets emotion, and silence finds a voice.**

### ✨ Vision

> "خاموشی کو لفظوں میں ڈھالنا"  
To give voice to the quietest parts of ourselves —  
To preserve the thoughts that once only echoed inside.

---

### 🗂️ Folder Structure

Each thought or poem has two files:
- `Title_EN.md` → English version  
- `Title_UR.md` → Urdu (Roman) version  

Both live side by side in harmony — just like our thoughts and translations often do.

### 💛 Welcome

Whether you read in English or Urdu,
Whether you're here to reflect or feel less alone,
You are welcome.

ہر فائل میں کوئی جذبہ چھپا ہے۔

جو باتیں کسی سے نہ کہہ سکیں — شاید یہاں وہ چپکے سے سن لی جائیں۔

Har file mein koi jazba chhupa hai.

Jo baatein kisi se na keh sakein — shayad yahan woh chupkay se sun li jaayein.

"The words we never dared to speak — may softly be heard here."

Because… sometimes, even code needs poetry.
