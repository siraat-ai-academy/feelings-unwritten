> _A readme that smiles, secures, and speaks from the valley of Azure._

### 😄 Introduction: Smiling in the Valley

Welcome to the **eks2 Readme** — where security isn't just a policy, but a pulse.

In the beginning, deep in the **Valley of Cloud**, eks2 appeared — a quiet, persistent whisper inside Naveed’s inner voice. He was not a certified cloud warrior, but he was a careful listener. And eks2 kept saying:

> _"To do, to do, to do... in sec, in sec, in sec."_

In every click, eks2 reminded him — **cloud security isn’t a setting. It’s a mindset.**
