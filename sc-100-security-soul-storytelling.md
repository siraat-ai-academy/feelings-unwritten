## 🌍 The Path Ahead

Some certifications teach you tools.  
Some prepare you for jobs.  
But this one... this is about the **inner infrastructure** of trust.

**SC-100** — Microsoft Certified: Cybersecurity Architect Expert —  
is not just an exam. It is a reflection of your ability to see the **full architecture of integrity** across clouds, across systems, and across human behaviors.

> But SC-100 teaches me to design the garden."

Eks2 didn’t come here just to pass an exam.  
He came here to understand how **systems and souls both need security** —  
not by restriction, but by intention.
