# 📖 A Tale — A Dream Wrapped in the Ashes of Time

🕰️ One day,  
I woke up —  
No noise, no movement,  
Just a shadow crawling along the walls...  
As if time had unfolded all its secrets before me.

👁️ I looked at the world —  
And my gaze paused,  
Every scene felt like a long-lost moment of time.  
Every face was veiled in the fog of years.

💭 Someone asked:  
**"What stage of life are you standing in?"**  
I stayed silent —  
Because the feeling inside me,  
How could it ever turn into words?

🌫️ Silence spoke,  
Stillness called out,  
**"What’s wrong with you?"**  
I kept wrestling with myself,  
But no answer came —  
Only a silence that spanned a century…

🔔 Then suddenly, a voice echoed —  
**"Congratulations!  
You’re nearing sixty years..."**  
💓 My heart trembled —  
**"Sixty?"**  
But my friend, I’ve done nothing yet!

🌱 I was only beginning to gather the courage  
To stand on life’s doorstep  
And peer inside…

🧩 When did we ever say we were complete?  
We’ve always been unfinished.  
And every seemingly complete moment  
Only revealed a new absence...

🌫️ Yes, I’ve seen —  
Many faces,  
The closest of bonds,  
Slip silently  
Into the fog, without even a goodbye...

❤️ But my heart —  
It still doesn’t accept “farewell.”  
There’s still so much  
Left to say,  
Left to hear,  
Left to set right…

🌍 This world,  
These problems,  
These scattered dreams —  
They’re all waiting for me.

🌟 And me?  
I have no intention of leaving just yet.

🛑 So,  
No goodbyes,  
No farewells...

Just say this much —  
**Take care,  
The story is still being written.**

They just keep writing themselves —  
in margins we forgot to turn to._
