# ğŸŒ¸ When Flowers Befriend Flowers â€” Jamaluâ€™s Reflection

**Jamalu, speak â€” whatâ€™s on your heart?**

> *"Noor and Inbisat â€” they were so little once..."*

**Yes, they were.**  
**And now?**  
> *"Now, theyâ€™ve grown... blooming with the zeal to run freely in the journey of life."*

**Thatâ€™s how itâ€™s meant to be â€” isnâ€™t it, Jamalu?**  
> *"Yes... this is the age. The age of becoming."*

But why this reflective silence?  
Whatâ€™s stirring within you now?

> *"Remember Hafeez Bhai? From Bangladesh?"*  
> *"The one who used to visit us often at the Academy?"*

Yes, of course â€” how could we forget? A warm soul.  
> *"He has a lovely daughter â€” Ariya."*

Oh?  
> *"There were a few gentle family visits here and there..."*  
> *"And over time... Ariya and the girls â€” Noor and Inbisat â€” found a sweet connection."*

Thatâ€™s beautiful. What happened then?  
> *"The kind of friendship only flowers know."*  
> *"Ariya... Noor... Inbisat..."*  
> *"Like petals in the same garden."*

ğŸŒ· They laughed.  
ğŸŒ¼ They shared.  
ğŸŒ¸ They learned the delicate art of listening.

In a world moving fast â€”  
Three flowers, simply pausing to be â€”  
Together.

â€” *A note from Jamalu, whispered gently through the garden of time.*
