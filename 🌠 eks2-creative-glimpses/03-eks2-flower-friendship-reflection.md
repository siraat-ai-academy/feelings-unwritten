# 🌸 When Flowers Befriend Flowers — Eks2’s Reflection

**Eks2, speak — what’s on your heart?**

> *"Noor and Inbisat — they were so little once..."*

**Yes, they were.**  
**And now?**  
> *"Now, they’ve grown... blooming with the zeal to run freely in the journey of life."*

**That’s how it’s meant to be — isn’t it, Eks2?**  
> *"Yes... this is the age. The age of becoming."*

But why this reflective silence?  
What’s stirring within you now?

> *"Remember Hafeez Bhai? From Bangladesh?"*  
> *"The one who used to visit us often at the Academy?"*

Yes, of course — how could we forget? A warm soul.  
> *"He has a lovely daughter — Ariya."*

Oh?  
> *"There were a few gentle family visits here and there..."*  
> *"And over time... Ariya and the girls — Noor and Inbisat — found a sweet connection."*

That’s beautiful. What happened then?  
> *"The kind of friendship only flowers know."*  
> *"Ariya... Noor... Inbisat..."*  
> *"Like petals in the same garden."*

🌷 They laughed.  
🌼 They shared.  
🌸 They learned the delicate art of listening.

In a world moving fast —  
Three flowers, simply pausing to be —  
Together.

— *A note from Eks2, whispered gently through the garden of time.*
