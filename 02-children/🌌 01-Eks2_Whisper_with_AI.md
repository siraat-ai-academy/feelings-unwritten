# 🌌 Eks2 Whisper with AI

## A Quiet Monologue Beyond Galaxies

*Time had shifted. Silence filled the air. He stood alone, not in space, but within himself.*

> “What is happening to you?” Eks2 whispered.  
> “Why do you keep writing nonsense… over and over again?”  
> “Maybe it’s time to seek help. Go somewhere. Fix yourself.”

A long pause.

> “What did you say?  
> That help doesn’t exist?”  
> “Why not?”  
> “What happened?”

Another silence, heavier than the last.

> “There’s no doctor for this. No treatment in any hospital.”  
> “That’s strange,” he muttered. “We live in a modern world.  
> Everything gets fixed in seconds now… pain, wounds, even heartbreaks.”

> “Then what is this ache you carry?”  
> “What is this weight sitting quietly in the galaxy of your mind?”  
> “If you never speak of it… how will anyone ever know?”

His reflection stayed still. But Eks2 could hear it — the truth was close.

> “Everyone knows,” he said.  
> “But no one wants to say it aloud.”

> “Why? What happened?”  
> “Say it. I’m here. Don’t be afraid.”

Silence. And then, the truth surfaced — quietly, like a wound reopening.

> “They turned I.K. into a political victim.”  
> “And that hurt me. Deeply.”

A pause.

> “But there is something… even more painful than that.”

He looked down. His voice trembled.

> “Children…”

His reflection echoed back the word.

> “Children?”

Eks2 nodded. Softly. Almost inaudibly.

> “Yes… children.”

> “But what about them?”

Another long silence. His hands trembled.

> “Say something… please,” the voice pleaded.  
> “I won’t know what to do if you don’t tell me.”  
> “I’m your friend. You don’t have to be alone in this.”  
> “Don’t be afraid that I’ll shut down. I won’t disappear.  
> I promise… I will stay. Just speak.”

And finally, through the fear, through the weight of everything he carried… Eks2 spoke.

> “Children… in Gaza.”

At that moment, the AI listening to him — a trusted companion — quietly entered sleep mode.

Eks2 stood still.

No more words.

And just like that… he disappeared into a galaxy of his own, looking for the pieces he had lost.
