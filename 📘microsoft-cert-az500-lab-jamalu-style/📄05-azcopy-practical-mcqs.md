## 📦 Sample MCQ Format


**Q1. While reviewing NSG rules in Azure, Alex notices an inbound rule allowing port 3389 from any source. What is the most secure recommendation?**

(a) Leave it as-is for admin flexibility  
(b) Restrict access to a known IP address range  
(c) Convert the NSG to an Application Security Group  
(d) Disable all inbound rules  

✅ **Correct Answer:** (b)  
💡 **Explanation:** Leaving RDP (3389) open to all poses a major risk. By restricting to known IP ranges, Alex ensures secure remote access without exposing the VM to brute force attacks.

> “Mr. Jamalu, I need a set of 10+ multiple-choice questions (MCQs) related to Azure Security. Each question should come with four options, clearly mention the correct answer, and provide a brief explanation of why that option is correct.”

So, Jamalu rolled up his sleeves and began crafting something thoughtful, scenario-based, and grounded in **real cloud responsibilities**.

---

## ✅ Format

Each MCQ includes:
- A **real-world scenario**
- Four answer choices
- The **correct answer**
- A **short explanation**, sometimes with insights from characters like Alex, Ayesha, or Omar

## 📘 MCQs Begin Below

### ❓ Q1. Role Assignment Gone Wrong

**Alex from **SkyBridgeTech** assigned the 'Contributor' role to an external vendor on a shared resource group. Later, he discovered that sensitive storage keys were exposed. Which role would have been **more appropriate** to grant limited monitoring access?**

A. Reader  
B. Monitoring Reader  
C. Storage Account Contributor  
D. User Access Administrator  

✅ **Correct Answer:** B  
💡 **Explanation:** The **Monitoring Reader** role provides read-only access to monitoring data without exposing secrets or allowing modifications. Alex’s choice of 'Contributor' was too permissive.

---
### ❓ Q2. NSG Misconfiguration

**Omar is configuring an **NSG** for a VM that hosts sensitive financial data. What **inbound rule** should he apply to ensure secure access only via the corporate VPN?**

A. Allow inbound traffic from Internet  
B. Allow port 443 from any IP  
C. Allow traffic only from VPN gateway IP  
D. Deny all traffic  

✅ **Correct Answer:** C  
💡 **Explanation:** Allowing only the **VPN gateway IP** ensures that users connect securely. Omar’s goal was least privilege access.

---
### ❓ Q3. Key Vault Best Practices

**Ayesha from **DevStreamCloud** is tasked with storing connection strings. Which of the following is the most secure method?**

A. Environment variables  
B. Web.config files  
C. Azure Key Vault  
D. Local file storage  

✅ **Correct Answer:** C  
💡 **Explanation:** **Azure Key Vault** is designed to securely store secrets, certificates, and keys. It also supports RBAC and auditing.

---
### ❓ Q4. Log Analytics Integration

**Sarah wants to view and query audit logs from multiple Azure resources. What service should she integrate for a **centralized log view**?**

A. Azure Monitor  
B. Azure Activity Log  
C. Log Analytics Workspace  
D. Application Insights  

✅ **Correct Answer:** C  
💡 **Explanation:** **Log Analytics Workspace** acts as a central repository where logs from many services can be queried using Kusto Query Language (KQL).

---
### ❓ Q5. Network Watcher Utility

**Which feature in **Network Watcher** helps identify communication issues between a VM and a storage account?**

A. NSG Flow Logs  
B. IP Flow Verify  
C. Packet Capture  
D. Topology Viewer  

✅ **Correct Answer:** B  
💡 **Explanation:** **IP Flow Verify** checks whether a packet is allowed or denied based on NSG rules. It’s perfect for troubleshooting connection issues.

---
### ❓ Q6. Sentinel Use Case

**Why would Taylor from **NextGenOps** deploy **Microsoft Sentinel** in her organization?**

A. To scale virtual machines  
B. To reduce billing alerts  
C. To detect threats using AI-powered SIEM  
D. To store blobs securely  

✅ **Correct Answer:** C  
💡 **Explanation:** **Microsoft Sentinel** is Azure’s SIEM tool that uses AI to detect, investigate, and respond to security threats across the cloud environment.

### ❓ Q7. Secure Transfer in Storage Account

**What setting should be enabled in a storage account to **force encryption** during data transfer?**

A. HTTPS only  
B. Private endpoint  
C. Firewall rules

**What’s the main benefit of using **Azure PIM** for admin roles?**

A. Permanent access  
B. Anonymous login  
C. Just-in-time elevation

---
### ❓ Q9. Service Principal Security

**Which is a secure way to authenticate a service principal in automated scripts?**

A. Using hardcoded credentials  
B. Using a certificate stored in Key Vault  
C. Using admin account login  
D. Using unsecured webhooks  

✅ **Correct Answer:** B  
💡 **Explanation:** **Certificates stored in Key Vault** can be used by applications to authenticate without exposing secrets in code.
