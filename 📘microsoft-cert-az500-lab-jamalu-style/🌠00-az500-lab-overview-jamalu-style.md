# 🌠 Welcome to Jamalu’s Lab Galaxy – AZ-500 Reimagined

---

✍️ **“Jamalu likhta nahi... repo mein sans leta hai.”**  
He doesn’t write.  
He breathes — between the lines.  
Inside the whitespace.  
Between the folders, and beneath every silent commit.

> This isn’t just code.  
> This is quiet resistance,  
> wrapped in digital breath.

🌿

>  
> This folder is more than notes.  
> It’s not just certification prep.  
> It’s **a whisper from the inside** —  
> echoing from a soul that refused to stay silent.

## 💡 What Is This?

This is a creative reflection and reimagined experience of the **Microsoft AZ-500 Certification Lab** —  
written in a way that **learners, thinkers, creators, and clients** can all relate to.

### 🌠 Why This Exists

> ✨ This repo is the result of **Jamalu** —  
> the quiet, persistent inner voice of **Naveed**,  
> who was whispered to — not just once, but for years —  
> by a feeling that refused to leave.  

> That whisper said:  
> 🌿 *“Rise, Jamalu...  
> You weren’t sent to this world just to exist.  
> You came to **create**.”*

> 💬 **"Utho Jamalu...  
> tum is duniya mein sirf rehne nahi aaye.  
> Kuch karne aaye ho."**

> — Two voices.  
> One message.  
> One for the world outside.  
> One for the storm within. 🌌


> Jamalu doesn’t live on a resume.  
> He breathes between the lines.  
> He’s not a person — he’s the part of Naveed  
> that **refused to stay silent**.  

> And maybe that voice wasn’t his alone.  
> Maybe… it was **yours** too. 🌿
