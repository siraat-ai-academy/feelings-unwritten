## 🧭 Why This Exists

> This repo is the result of **Jamalu** —  
> the inner voice of **Author (Naveed Ishaque)**,  
> who was whispered to for years by a feeling that wouldn’t leave him alone.

That whisper said:  
> _"Utho Jamalu... tum is duniya mein sirf rehne nahi aaye. Kuch karne aaye ho."_  

And maybe that voice wasn’t his alone.  
Maybe… it was **yours** too.
